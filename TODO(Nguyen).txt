TODAY: 
    API stub:     
        Search for hotels (1h) [] @Current 
        Return hotel details (1h) [] 
    
TODO: 
    Learn how Sequence Diagram works (1h) [] @Next
    Wrap the development environment in Docker (4h) [] @Maybe

    <insert a Sequence Diagram for clearer> (2h)
        -> How the API flow gonna works: 
            1. User call to route 
            2. route call controller 
            3. controller calls 'model'(the data part) and 'service'(the logic part) -> get the result back 
            4. controller return the result back to the view  

        Init project: 
            Understand Sequelize (2h) []
            Setup folder structure (2h) []
            Init Development Rules (1h) []
                -> Where to put things ? 

            Setup Development Environment Specs (2h) []
                -> Database Software
                    -> Connection port 
                -> Node version


DONE:  
    Understand Sequelize (2h) [X] 
    Scraping data (4h) [X] 
    Connect front-end and back-end with a simple message: (2h) [X] 
        “Hello Backend” from React front-end
        “Hello React” from Express back-end

    Wrap the development environment in Docker (4h) @Later
        -> learn how Docker works 
            -> Can use bind mount to mount the source code to local dev environment 

    Init the database to make it works (1h) [X] 
    Setup folder structure (2h) [X]
    -> Init Development Rules (1h) [X]
