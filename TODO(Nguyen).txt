        Image Hosting service - cloudinary (4h) [] 
            NOTES: 
                should we just convert the image to base64 on the client 
                then send to the server
                then the server will again send that to the image hosting services

                the server is the one who actually send the image to the cloudinary storage 
                -> server: get the image from the client then send it to cloudinary 
                -> client: only get the image from the url 

            Our database will only store the url/id of the image
